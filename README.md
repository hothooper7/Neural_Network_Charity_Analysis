# Neural Network Charity Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier.  This model will help predict if applicants that receive funding from Alphabet Soup will be successful.  

## Results

Data Preprocessing

* The column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the target for this model, and contains binary data that predicts if the funding was used effectively.
* The remaining columns such as "APPLICATION_TYPE" and "AFFILIATION" are the features for this model.
* The columns EIN and Name have been dropped from the model as they are for identification purposes and have no value for this exercise.
